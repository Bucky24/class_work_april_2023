# Module 09 Mini-Project: Portfolio Generator

In this activity, you will build a command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from user input.

## Instructions

* Your application should prompt the user for information like their name, location, bio, LinkedIn URL, and GitHub URL. Feel free to add any additional prompts you think of.

* An HTML document containing the information collected from the prompts should be constructed and written to the file system. Make sure to add some CSS styling to the document.

* You‚Äôll need the following tools and technologies to accomplish this:

  * `fs` for writing to the file system

  * `inquirer` version 8.2.4 for collecting user input

  * String template literals for generating a string version of the HTML document before it is written to the file system

## üí° Hints

It might be a good idea to start building out the HTML skeleton in a real HTML file. Once you're happy with the HTML file's appearance in the browser, you can copy and paste its contents into a string template literal. Then you can write a function to insert the user input into the appropriate places in the HTML string before writing it to the file system.

## üèÜ Bonus

* Instead of using callback functions, what are some other tools in JavaScript we can use to handle asynchronous functionality?
